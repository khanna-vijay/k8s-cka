The **Kubernauts** training plan is a collaborative effort that actively seeks feedback from the community to ensure that we can best serve your needs.  To facilitate feedback and development of the training plan a mindmap has been published which provides a high level overview.  The **Kubernauts** actively seek your input to shape this training plan.
