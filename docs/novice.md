## Basic Training

Kubernauts assess the available free training for the following:

* Currency.  It is not teaching things that are no longer applicable.
* Quality.  It is of high quality.
* Relevancy.  In combination with the other free training it helps to provide a comprehensive introduction to Kubernetes.

Kubernauts then provide a training plan that if followed will take a learner through the basics of understanding Kubernetes.
