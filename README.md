# Kubernauts Training

The [Kubernauts](https://kubernauts.io/) is a non-profit initiative that offers free training for [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and [Cloud Native](https://www.cncf.io) technologies.

Our mission is to create and drive adoption of both Kubernetes and Cloud Native Thinking / Strategy.  Thus, helping DevOps teams to be more productive and successful. We believe that through training and community based activities we can help to foster Kubernetes and Cloud Native adoption.

Our training provides a clear, structured path that if followed will help the learner to understand the fundmantals of Kubernetes and Cloud Native technologies. Continuing on until they are at the  level of a professional consultant.

Please see the [Kubernauts Charter](https://kubernauts.io/en/kubernauts-charter.html) for more information about our mission.
